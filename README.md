## A personal collection of tweaks to Linux-based systems.

I've tried somewhat to use software that doesn't [suck too much][1], but is also very configurable.
Also, I've tried to create a system that doesn't use an insane amount of resources. So far, moderate success.

There are old-school, powerful tools out there do do many given tasks. (Emacs, Vi/Vim, Arch, etc) I'm not a fan, because they often rely on antequated designs for their UX. It makes them unnecessarily hard to use for modern-day users.

I'm also not a fan of slapping everything onto Electron or some other JS-style platform. So I've attempted to get modern software created with our current, better understanding of UX that also integrates the superior old-school values of well-written, efficient code in a fast language.
